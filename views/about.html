      <p>
        Sushi-ME-Away! is a directory that one day, will be populated with all the take-out sushi stores in Hong Kong. We are always on the lookout for affordable and tasty sushi take-outs since eating out is a big no-no when you're coding 24/7 at General Assembly. That's why creating Sushi-ME-Away! was an easy decision for us, a database directory offering soley sushi take-outs for sushi-lovers!
